### Breaking Changes

#### `respect_gitignore` defaults to `true`

pks now respects `.gitignore` files by default. Files and directories matched by
`.gitignore`, `.git/info/exclude`, or your global gitignore (`core.excludesFile`)
are excluded from analysis.

**Who is affected:** any project that previously relied on pks analyzing gitignored
paths — for example, vendored code checked into `.gitignore`-excluded directories,
or generated files that matter for boundary checking.

**What changes:** pks silently produces different (smaller) results without any
configuration change. This is intentional: most projects want gitignored files
excluded, and the old behavior (analyze everything) was rarely desired.

**Opt out:** add the following to `packwerk.yml` to restore the previous behavior:

```yaml
respect_gitignore: false
```
