A 100% Rust implementation of [packwerk](https://github.com/Shopify/packwerk) and [packwerk-extensions](https://github.com/rubyatscale/packwerk-extensions), a gradual modularization platform for Ruby.

Currently, it ships the following checkers to help improve the boundaries between packages. These checkers are:
- A `dependency` checker requires that a pack specifies packs on which it depends. Cyclic dependencies are not allowed. See [packwerk](https://github.com/Shopify/packwerk)
- A `privacy` checker that ensures other packages are using your package's public API
- A `visibility` checker that allows packages to be private except to an explicit group of other packages.
- A `folder_privacy` checker that allows packages to their sibling packs and parent pack (to be used in an application that uses folder packs)
- A `layer` (formerly `architecture`) checker that allows packages to specify their "layer" and requires that each layer only communicate with layers below it.

See [Checkers](CHECKERS.md) for detailed descriptions.

# Fork
This repo was forked directly from https://github.com/alexevanczuk/packs

# Goals:

## Run 20x faster than `packwerk` on most projects
- Currently ~10-20x as fast as the ruby implementation. See [BENCHMARKS.md](https://github.com/rubyatscale/pks/blob/main/BENCHMARKS.md).
- Your mileage may vary!
- Other performance improvements are coming soon!

## Support non-Rails, non-zeitwerk apps
- Currently supports non-Rails apps through an experimental implementation
- Uses the same public API as `packwerk`, but has different behavior.
- See [EXPERIMENTAL_PARSER_USAGE.md](https://github.com/rubyatscale/pks/blob/main/EXPERIMENTAL_PARSER_USAGE.md) for more info

# Installation
See [INSTALLATION.md](https://github.com/rubyatscale/pks/blob/main/INSTALLATION.md)

# Using with VSCode/RubyMine Extension
`packwerk` has a VSCode Extension: https://github.com/rubyatscale/packwerk-vscode/tree/main

It also has a RubyMine Extension: https://github.com/vinted/packwerk-intellij

Using the extension with `pks` is straightforward and results in a much more responsive experience.

Directions:
- Follow [INSTALLATION.md](https://github.com/rubyatscale/pks/blob/main/INSTALLATION.md) instructions to install `pks`
- Follow the [configuration](https://github.com/rubyatscale/packwerk-vscode/tree/main#configuration) directions to configure the extension to use `pks` instead of the ruby gem by setting the executable to `pks check`

# Not yet supported
- custom inflections
- custom load paths
- extensible plugin system

# Behavioral differences
There are still some known behavioral differences between `pks` and `packwerk`. If you find any, please file an issue!
- `package_paths` must not end in a slash, e.g. `pks/*/` is not supported, but `pks/*` is.
- A `**` in `package_paths` is supported, but is not a substitute for a single `*`, e.g. `pks/**` is supported and will match `pks/*/*/package.yml`, but will not match `pks/*/package.yml`. `pks/*` must be used to match that.

## Default Namespaces
`pks` supports Zeitwerk default namespaces. However, since it doesn't have access to the Rails runtime, you need to explicitly specify the namespaces in `packwerk.yml`.

For example, if you're using [`packs-rails`](https://github.com/rubyatscale/packs-rails) and [`automatic_namespaces`](https://github.com/gap777/automatic_namespaces) to configure your default namespaces, and you have
- `pks/foo/app/models/bar.rb` which is configured to define `Foo::Bar`
- `pks/foo/app/domain/baz.rb` which is configured to define `Foo::Baz`

You'll need to specify the default namespaces in `packwerk.yml` like so:
```yml
autoload_roots:
  packs/foo/app/models: "::Foo"
  packs/foo/app/domain: "::Foo"
```

## "check" error messages
The error messages resulting from running `pks check` can be customized with mustache-style interpolation. The available
variables are:
- violation_name
- referencing_pack_name
- defining_pack_name
- constant_name
- reference_location
- referencing_pack_relative_yml

Layer violations also have 
- defining_layer
- referencing_layer

Example:
packwerk.yml
```yml
checker_overrides:
  folder_privacy_error_template: "{{reference_location}} {{violation_name}} / Product Service Privacy Violation: `{{constant_name}}` belongs to the `{{defining_pack_name}}` product service, which is not visible to `{{referencing_pack_name}}` as it is a different product service. See https://go/pks-folder-privacy"
  layer_error_template: "{{reference_location}}Layer violation: `{{constant_name}}` belongs to `{{defining_pack_name}}` (whose layer is `{{defining_layer}}`) cannot be accessed from `{{referencing_pack_name}}` (whose layer is `{{referencing_layer}}`). See https://go/pks-layer"
  visibility_error_template: "{{reference_location}}Visibility violation: `{{constant_name}}` belongs to `{{defining_pack_name}}`, which is not visible to `{{referencing_pack_name}}`. See https://go/pks-visibility"
  privacy_error_template: "{{reference_location}}Privacy violation: `{{constant_name}}` is private to `{{defining_pack_name}}`, but referenced from `{{referencing_pack_name}}`. See https://go/pks-privacy"
  dependency_error_template: "{{reference_location}}Dependency violation: `{{constant_name}}` belongs to `{{defining_pack_name}}`, but `{{referencing_pack_relative_yml}}` does not specify a dependency on `{{defining_pack_name}}`. See https://go/pks-dependency"
```
